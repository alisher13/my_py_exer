In this exercises I perform data analysis on some html files in a folder on my system. The files contain ranks of baby names for 1992-2010. In this script I analyze the data to come up with some findings. The script reveals:
i) top baby names in the 20-year period as opposed to annual ranks
ii) names with increasing popularity in the last two decades (among most consitent names)
